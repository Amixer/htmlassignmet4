         <h2>Unknowing Enthusiasm</h2>
         <p>Once upon a time, but actually this happens a lot so lots upon a time. A person came out ready for an
            adventure.
            Off in the distance there was a great party. A crowd of people on a hilltop not far away. She thought this
            would
            be a great place to start the adventure. Join those people on the hill and perhaps make her way towards the
            mountains in the distance.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>The ground ahead was a little bumpy looking, but mostly flat. She could see that there were a few others on
            the
            path to the hilltop and she decided to go with them. She saw that there were some people stood at the base
            of the
            hill and they were calling out to the group of adventurers but they were too far to hear their words.</p>
         <p>The beginning of the journey was quite simple the adventurers found the ground easy to traverse. And with
            each
            step those on the hilltop came closer and their words became clearer.</p>
         <p>"What out for the bogs!"&nbsp;</p>
         <p>"Take care of your shoes!"</p>
         <p>"Always bring a pen!"</p>
         <p>The adventurers heard these bits of knowledge and filed them away. They weren't super useful in that moment
            but
            the words were heart felt it was clear they meant something to those at the base of the hill.</p>
         <p>It didn't take long to realize that those warnings would not be of use for quite sometime. After another few
            miles
            the flat ground fell away and between the adventurers and the very base of the hill was a massive and
            seemingly
            impassible crevasse.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>Those at the other side was gesturing wildly and pointing towards a spot where there was a path to climb
            down.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>"It's not that bad!"&nbsp;</p>
         <p>"You can get down there!"</p>
         <p>"Watch out for the loose stones!"</p>

         <img src="images/crevasse.jpg" alt="crevasse">
         <p>So the adventurers decide to follow the directions and climb down the side of the crevasse. Though it looks
            scary
            and deep and not at all the fun adventure they'd envisioned. A few of the group peer out of the abyss and
            change
            their mind. They decide to go back. Some choose to go down a different way. But there's still a decent group
            heading for the indicated decent.</p>
         <p>The group goes slowly climbing down the side of the crevasse. And those on the other side are still calling
            out.
         </p>
         <p>"Watch out for that boulder below!"</p>
         <p>"Adjust your feet to the right!"</p>
         <p>"Move just a hair to the left!"</p>
         <p>But with their backs to the other side it's hard to tell what they're talking about.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>A few people lose their grip and fall. Some get part way down and decide to climb back out. Some climb down
            fast
            but are not there when the group hits the bottom.</p>
         <p>The bottom of the crevasse and it's a vast and densely grown jungle. There's a river, and a bog, and wild
            animals
            and long grasses. There's lots of ways to get lost, broken and hurt. Those above are still calling but it's
            harder
            to make out the advice this far down.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>Something about a rope ladder, and something about a tree fort? But regardless the group moves
            forward.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>To be continued.....</p>
